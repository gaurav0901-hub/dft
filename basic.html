            <h2>Condensed Matter Basics</h2>
            <h3>What is Condensed Matter Physics?</h3>
            <p>It’s the study of solids, liquids, and other phases where particles stick close together and interact—like the stuff around us! Unlike particle physics (tiny lone particles), this is about materials like metals, insulators, and superconductors.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts Made Simple</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crystals and Lattices:</strong> Imagine atoms in a perfect grid, like tiles on a floor. These repeating patterns (unit cells) define solids.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrons in Solids:</strong> Electrons move in “energy highways” called bands, not freely like in a gas.</li>
                <li><strong>Phases and Transitions:</strong> Materials can melt or become superconducting—think of ice turning to water, but cooler!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>From semiconductors in your phone to magnets in motors, condensed matter physics powers our world. As physicists have known since the 1950s (thanks, Kittel!), it’s everywhere.</p>
