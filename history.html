            <h2>History of Condensed Matter Physics</h2>
            <h3>Early Foundations (1800s–1920s)</h3>
            <p>It began with crystallography—think Bragg figuring out how X-rays bounce off crystals—and Drude’s idea of electrons as a gas in metals.</p>

            <h3>Quantum Revolution (1920s–1950s)</h3>
            <p>Quantum mechanics changed everything: Bloch gave us electron waves, and band theory explained conductors vs. insulators. The transistor (1947) was born!</p>

            <h3>Condensed Matter Takes Shape (1960s–Now)</h3>
            <p>Superconductivity got its theory (BCS, 1957), soft matter joined in, and DFT emerged (Hohenberg-Kohn, 1964) to calculate material properties. Nobel Prize for DFT in 1998 sealed its legacy.</p>
